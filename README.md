# Objective of this project  
This project aims to develop and compare different machine learning models for multi-class skin lesion classification. It focuses on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of models through data augmentation and sensitivity analysis.  

<b>I am going to offer those facilities in this project:</b>  
1. Collect and preprocess a publicly available skin lesion dataset.  
2. Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, CNNs, ResNet, and EfficientNet.  
3. Incorporate data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, contrast adjustment, and noise injection.  
4. Perform sensitivity analysis on dataset size, augmentation intensity, and hyperparameter tuning.  
5. Develop a web application for real-time skin lesion image classification.
